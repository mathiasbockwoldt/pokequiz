# Pokémon quiz

This is a very simple Pokémon quiz where the user has to enter the names of all Pokémon of the first generation (i.e. the first 151). Just open `quiz.html` in some modern browser and start typing the names. Pressing `<enter>` is not necessary.

Due to copyright, the images are not provided in this repo. If you really want to, please download the files from somewhere and place them in a folder called `images/`. The quiz also works without the images, though.
